icet
====

**icet** is a the tool for the construction and sampling of alloy
cluster expansions. A detailed description of the functionality
provided as well as an extensive tutorial can be found in the `user
guide <https://icet.materialsmodeling.org/>`_

**icet** is written in Python, which allows easy integration with
countless first-principles codes and analysis tools accessible in
Python, and allows for a simple and intuitive user interface.  All
computationally demanding parts are, however, written in C++ providing
performance while maintaining portability.  The following snippet
illustrates how one can train a cluster expansion:

.. code-block:: python

   cs = ClusterSpace(primitive_cell, cutoffs, species)
   sc = StructureContainer(cs, list_of_training_structure)
   opt = Optimizer(sc.get_fit_data())
   opt.train()
   ce = ClusterExpansion(cs, opt.parameters)

Afterwards the cluster expansion can be used in various ways, e.g., for finding
ground state structures or for running Monte Carlo simulations.


Installation
------------

**icet** can be installed by cloning the repository and running the
``setup.py`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone git@gitlab.com:materials-modeling/icet.git
  cd icet
  python3 setup.py install --user

**icet** requires Python3 and invokes functionality from several
external libraries including the `atomic simulation environment
<https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_, `pandas
<https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_, and
`spglib <https://atztogo.github.io/spglib/>`_.  Installation also
requires a C++11 compliant compiler. Please consult the `installation
section of the user guide
<https://icet.materialsmodeling.org/installation.html>`_ for details.
