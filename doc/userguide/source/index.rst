:program:`icet` â€” A Pythonic approach to cluster expansions
***********************************************************

:program:`icet` is a tool for the construction and sampling of alloy cluster
expansions. A detailed description of the functionality provided as well as an
extensive tutorial can be found in the `user guide
<https://icet.materialsmodeling.org/>`_.

:program:`icet` is written in Python, which enables easy integration with
many first-principles codes and analysis tools accessible from Python, and
allows for a simple and intuitive user interface. All computationally demanding
parts are, however, written in C++ ensuring performance while maintaining
portability.

The following snippet provides a minimal example for its usage:

.. code-block:: python

   cs = ClusterSpace(primitive_cell, cutoffs, species)
   sc = StructureContainer(cs)
   for structure in training_structures:
       sc.add_structure(structure)
   opt = Optimizer(sc.get_fit_data())
   opt.train()
   ce = ClusterExpansion(cs, opt.parameters)

:program:`icet` has been developed at the `Department of Physics
<https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/physics/Pages/default.aspx>`_
of `Chalmers University of Technology <https://www.chalmers.se/>`_ in
Gothenburg, Sweden, and the `Data and Software Management Center
<https://europeanspallationsource.se/data-management-software#data-analysis-modelling>`_
at the European Spallation Source in Copenhagen, Denmark. Please
consult the :ref:`credits page <credits>` for information on how to
cite :program:`icet`.

:program:`icet` and its development are hosted on `gitlab
<https://gitlab.com/materials-modeling/icet>`_. Bugs and feature
requests are ideally submitted via the `gitlab issue tracker
<https://gitlab.com/materials-modeling/icet/issues>`_. The development
team can also be reached by email via icet@materialsmodeling.org.
